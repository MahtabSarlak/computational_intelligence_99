# computational_intelligence_99
This repository is for fall 2020 computational Engineering course where i put my assignments assigned throughout the semester. These assignments are a good practice for acquiring basic knowledge regarding Machine/Deep learning.
## Assignment Descriptions

### HW1
The first part of hw1 required us to implement a Gradient Descent algorithm for COVID-19 Prediction in Iran Based on datas provided by [who](https://www.who.int).
The second part required us to implement polynomial regression for asnwering previous issue.

### HW2
This assignment required us to preprocess the given [dataset](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=192) and then implement SVM(using sklearn) and KNN(from scratch).

### HW3
This assignment required us to propose a model for dog breed classification using [stanford dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs). 

Two models are implemented for breed classification. First one is AlexNet that is trained and implemented from scratch, and second one is Xception that is implemented and trained using pre_trained weights. Therefore accuracy of Xception is more than AlexNet by a large margin.


### News top classification
This assignment required us to propose a model for Persian News Categories classification using NLP techniques and the this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/computational-intelligence-course-final-project/data).
